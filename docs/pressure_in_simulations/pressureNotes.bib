abstract  ="The pressure of suspensions of self-propelled objects is
studied theoretically and by simulation of spherical active Brownian
particles (ABPs). We show that for certain geometries{,} the mechanical
pressure as force/area of confined systems can be equally expressed by
bulk properties{,} which implies the existence of a nonequilibrium
equation of state. Exploiting the virial theorem{,} we derive expressions
for the pressure of ABPs confined by solid walls or exposed to periodic
boundary conditions. In both cases{,} the pressure comprises three
contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random forces{,}
an activity-induced pressure (“swim pressure”){,} which can be expressed
in terms of a product of the bare and a mean effective particle
velocity{,} and the contribution by interparticle forces. We find that
the pressure of spherical ABPs in confined systems explicitly depends on
the presence of the confining walls and the particle–wall interactions{,}
which has no correspondence in systems with periodic boundary conditions.
Our simulations of three-dimensional ABPs in systems with periodic
boundary conditions reveal a pressure–concentration dependence that
becomes increasingly nonmonotonic with increasing activity. Above a
critical activity and ABP concentration{,} a phase transition occurs{,}
which is reflected in a rapid and steep change of the pressure. We
present and discuss the pressure for various activities and analyse the
contributions of the individual pressure components."}
