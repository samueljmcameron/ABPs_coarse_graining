\section{Microscopic definition of pressure.}
\subsection{System with walls.}

Following appendix C of \cite{C5SM01412C}.

Define the pressure, $p^{e,\alpha}$ on a surface of area
$\Delta S^{\alpha}$ as
\begin{align}\label{eq:pfund}
  p^{e,\alpha}\Delta S^{\alpha}
  \equiv -\sum_{i\in\Delta S^{\alpha}}
  <\bm{F}_i^{s,{\alpha}}\cdot\bm{n}_i^{\alpha}>.
\end{align}
$\bm{F}_i^{s,{\alpha}}$ is the force exerted on the surface
(e.g. through some potential energy of the surface) due to
the $i^{th}$ particle, and $\bm{n}_i^{\alpha}$ is the normal
to the surface at the location of the $i^{th}$ particle. The
centre of $\Delta S^{\alpha}$ is at $\bm{r}^{\alpha}$, and
the normal at $\bm{r}^{\alpha}$ is $\bm{n}^{\alpha}$.

Assume $\Delta S^{\alpha}$ is smooth (curvature variations
are small compared to some particle length scale $\sigma$).
More concretely, this is saying that the change in curvature
of the wall at any two points within $\Delta S^{\alpha}$ is
small, $\sigma d\bm{n}/dr^{\alpha}|_{\Delta S^{\alpha}}\ll 1$.
This should be valid for small enough $\Delta S^{\alpha}$.
Then, we can say that
$\bm{n}_i^{\alpha}\approx\bm{n}^{\alpha}$. We can now re-write
eqn \ref{eq:pfund} as
\begin{align}
  p^{e,\alpha}\Delta S^{\alpha}\bm{n}^{\alpha}
  \cdot\bm{r}^{\alpha}
  \approx -\sum_{i\in\Delta S^{\alpha}}<\bm{F}_i^{s,\alpha}>
\end{align}
where we have multiplied both sides by the dot product
$\bm{r}^{\alpha}\cdot\bm{n}^{\alpha}$.

Next, define $d\bm{S}\equiv\Delta S^{\alpha}\bm{n}^{\alpha}$,
and use the assumption that for small enough $d\bm{S}$,
$\bm{r}^{\alpha}\approx\bm{r}_i^{\alpha}$ so that the sum over
all $\alpha$ is
\begin{align}
  \sum_{\alpha}p^{e,\alpha}\Delta S\bm{n}^{\alpha}
  \cdot\bm{r}^{\alpha}
  \approx -\sum_{\alpha}\sum_{i\in\Delta S^{\alpha}}
  <\bm{F}_i^{s,\alpha}\cdot\bm{r}_i^{\alpha}>
  \approx-\sum_{i=1}^{N}<\bm{F}_i^{s}\bm{r}_i>.
\end{align}
In the last line, I have assumed that each particle only
exerts forces on one surface element. This is not the case
at e.g. corners, but errors introduced from this assumption
should be negligible in the limit of large particle number,
as only a small number of particles can be within a close
enough distance to a wall corner to feel multiple surface
elements. In the limit of $\Delta S\to 0$, the sum over
$\alpha$ becomes an integral, and the approximations above
become exact (aside from the corner discussion).
replacing the discrete $\bm{r}^{\alpha}$ to a continuous
vector $\bm{r}$, and using the divergence theorem,
\begin{align}
  \int_{S} p^e(\bm{r})\bm{r}\cdot d\bm{S}
  =\int_V\nalba\cdot(p^e(\bm{r})\bm{r})d^dr
  =-\sum_{i=1}^{N}<\bm{F}_i^{s}\bm{r}_i>
\end{align}
where $d$ is the volume element in $d$ dimensions.

Finally, if $p^e$ is independent of position, then in $d$
dimensions the pressure on a wall is
\begin{align}\label{eq:pwall}
  p^e
  =-\frac{1}{dV}\sum_{i=1}^{N}<\bm{F}_i^{s}\bm{r}_i>,
\end{align}
and so the pressure on the wall is the virial over all
surface forces.

\subsection{Periodic boundary conditions.}

\section{Standard method of pressure computation in LAMMPS.}

In LAMMPS, the pressure is computed by first assuming the formula
\begin{align}
  P_{\alpha\beta}V = \bigg<\sum_{i=1}^N(\m_i(\bm{v}_i)_{\alpha}
  (\bm{v}_i)_{\beta}+W_{\alpha\beta}(\{\bm{r}_i\}))\bigg>
\end{align}
is correct, where
\begin{align}
  W_{\alpha\beta}(\{\bm{r}_i\})\equiv\sum_{k\in\bm{0}}
  \sum_{w=1}^{N_k(\bm{r}_w^k)_{\alpha}
    (\bm{F}_w^k)_{\beta}
\end{align}
is the virial tensor, where the system has been broken into
$k$ groups of atoms which interact with each other (i.e.
are within cutoff distance of each other, and so an atom can
belong to multiple groups), and each group has $N_k$ atoms in
it. So $\bm{r}_w^k$ is the position of the $w^{th}$ atom in
group $k$, $\bm{F}_w^k$ is the force due to all atoms in group
$k$ on the $w^{th}$ atom in group $k$. The first summation,
with $k\in\bm{0}$, just states that the sum is over all group
images associated with the local lattice cell, and so it is
taken that $\bm{r}_1^k=\bm{r}_{i\bm{0}}$ is always in the local
cell. This is actually equivalent to the second in term in ref
Gompperant so can remain in the system.

Just need to figure out the term with summation over
$\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{\bm{n}}\bm{F}_{ij\bm{n}}\cdot\bm{e}_i$,
probably using same style as Thomson calculation for lammps.
(look at lammps code for insight??).

of interacting atoms having
  . Unfortunately, it is not. The first term can be easily
neglected by telling lammps not to compute it, but the second
term might still be some use if we can understand where it comes
from.

\section{Writing the active brownian particles equations of motion into
  the correct form}

The equations of motion for active brownian particles are:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eqs:basicABPsODEs_dimensional}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d\tilde{\bm{r}}_i}{d\tilde{t}}&=\tilde{\beta}
    \tilde{D}^t\big(\tilde{\bm{F}}_i
    +\tilde{f}^P\bm{P}_i\big)
    +\sqrt{2\tilde{D}^t}\tilde{\bm{\xi}}^r_i,\\
    \frac{d\theta_i}{dt}&=\sqrt{2\tilde{D}^r}
    \tilde{\bm{\xi}}^{\theta}_i.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\tilde{\bm{r}}_i=(x_i,y_i)$ are the particle positions,
$\bm{P}_i=(\cos\theta_i,\sin\theta_i)$ are the particle orientations,
and $\tilde{\bm{\xi}}^{a}_i$, $a=t,r$ are Gaussian white noise
with zero mean and unit variance, i.e.
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \big<(\tilde{\xi}^a_i(t))_{\gamma}\big>&=0,\\
    \big<(\tilde{\xi}^a_i(t))_{\gamma}(\tilde{\xi}^b_j(t'))_{\beta}\big>
    &=\delta_{\beta\gamma}\delta_{ij}\delta_{ab}\delta(t-t^{\prime}).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

If I take $\sigma$ (the length scale of the force $\bm{F}_i$) as the unit of
length, $\beta$ as the unit of energy, and $\tau = \sigma^2/D^t$ as the unit
of time, then eqn \ref{eqs:basicABPsODEs_dimensional} can be re-written as
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eqs:basicABPsODEs}
  \begin{align}
    \dot{\bm{r}}_i&=\bm{F}_i
    +f^P\bm{P}_i
    +\sqrt{2}\bm{\xi}^{r}_i,\label{eq:micro_pos}\\
    \dot\theta_i&=\sqrt{4\Pi}\xi^{\theta}_i,\label{eq:micro_theta}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where dots over variables are derivatives with respect to (dimensionless)
time $t$ and all variables without tildes are dimensionless, i.e.
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eqs:dimensionless}
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{t} &= t\frac{\sigma^2}{D^t},\\
    \tilde{\bm{r}}_i &= \bm{r}_i\sigma,\\
    \tilde{\bm{F}}_i & = \bm{F}_i\frac{1}{\beta\sigma},\\
    \tilde{f}^P &= f^P\frac{1}{\beta\sigma},\\
    \tilde{D}^r &= \Pi \frac{2D^t}{\sigma^2}.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Taking the dot product of eqn \ref{eq:micro_pos} with $\bm{r}_i$, and then
taking the ensemble average defined as
\begin{align}
  <\mathcal{O}(\bm{\xi}(t))>\frac{1}{Z}\int \mathcal{D}\bm{\xi}
  \mathcal{O}(\bm{\xi}(t))
  \exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\int_0^Tdt(\bm{\xi}(t))^2\bigg),
\end{align}
where the components of $\bm{\xi}$ include all particles, with each particle
having $3$ ($x$, $y$, and $\theta$) noise terms (and so $3N$ terms total),
we get
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}<\bm{r}_i^2>
  = <\bm{F}_i\cdot\bm{r}_i>+f^P<\bm{P}_i\cdot\bm{r}_i>
  +\sqrt{2}<\bm{\xi}^r\cdot\bm{r}_i>
\end{align}

\section{Ensemble-averaged quantities}

In this section, we evaluate ensemble averaged quantities by using the formal
solution to eqn \ref{eq:micro_pos}, namely
\begin{align}
  \bm{r}_i(t)=
  &\bm{r}_i(t-\Delta t)
  +\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1[\bm{F}_i(\{\bm{r}_j\})\nonumber\\
    &+f^P\bm{P}_i(t_1)
    +\sqrt{2}\bm{\xi}_i(t_1)].
\end{align}
Before evaluating, it is also useful to note that
\begin{align}
  <\bm{P}_i(t)\bm{P}_i(t')> = e^{-(d-1)\Pi |t-t'|}.
\end{align}
in $d$ dimensions...
BUT HOW DO I DERIVE THIS????
\subsection{$<\bm{P}_i\cdot\bm{r}_i>$}
\begin{widetext}
  \begin{align}
    <\bm{P}_i(t)\cdot\bm{r}_i(t)>=
    &<\bm{r}_i(t-\Delta t)\cdot\bm{P}_i(t)>
    +<\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1\big[\bm{F}_i(\{\bm{r}_j\})
      \cdot\bm{P}_i(t)+f^P\bm{P}_i(t_1)\cdot\bm{P}_i(t)
      +\sqrt{2}\bm{\xi}_i(t_1)\cdot\bm{P}_i(t)\big]>\nonumber\\
    =&\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1\big[<\bm{F}_i(\{\bm{r}_j\})
      \cdot\bm{P}_i(t)>+f^P<\bm{P}_i(t_1)\cdot\bm{P}_i(t)>
      +\sqrt{2}<\bm{\xi}_i(t_1)\cdot\bm{P}_i(t)>\big]\nonumber\\
  \end{align}
\end{widetext}

\section{Fokker-Planck equations\label{app:fokkerplanck}}

Now, I can define a vector of length $3N$ with components
\begin{align}
  \bm{r}=(\bm{r}^{(1)},\bm{r}^{(2)},\cdots,\bm{r}^{(N)},\theta_1,\theta_2,\cdots,
  \theta_N).
\end{align}

This will then give the differential equation
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}=\beta\bm{D}\cdot(\bm{F}(\bm{r})+\bm{v}(\bm{r}))
  +\sqrt{2D_{\alpha\beta}}u_{\beta}(t),
\end{align}
where $D_{\alpha\beta}$ is diagonal, and the values of the diagonal are
$D^t$ for the first $2N$ terms, and $D^r$ for the last $N$ terms.

Next, I will define
\begin{align}
  \bm{x}&\equiv(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{3N}),\\
  \nabla&\equiv(\partial_{x_1},\partial_{x_2},\cdots,\partial_{x_{3N}}).
\end{align}

as well as the stochastic probability density operator
\begin{align}
  \hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)=\delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t)).
\end{align}

Taking the partial derivative of this with respect to time gives
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial\hat{\rho}}{\partial t}
  &=-(\nabla_{\bm{x}}\delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t))
  \cdot\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}\nonumber\\
  &=-\nabla_{\bm{x}}\cdot\bigg(\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}
  \delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t)\bigg)\nonumber\\
  &=-\nabla_{\bm{x}}\cdot\hat{\bm{j}}(\bm{x},t),
\end{align}
where I have defined the stochastic current operator
\begin{align}
  \hat{\bm{j}}(\bm{x},t)\equiv
  &\beta\bm{D}\cdot\bm{F}(\bm{x})\delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t))
  +\beta\bm{D}\bm{v}(\bm{x})\delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t))\nonumber\\
  &+\sqrt{2D_{\alpha\beta}}u_{\beta}(t)
  \delta(\bm{x}-\bm{r}(t))\nonumber\\
  =&\beta\bm{D}\cdot\bm{F}(\bm{x})\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)
  +\beta\bm{D}\cdot\bm{v}(\bm{x})\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)\nonumber\\
  &+\sqrt{2D_{\alpha\beta}}u_{\beta}(t)\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t).
\end{align}

You can average $\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)$ over the fluctuations $\bm{u}(t)$, and
get the resulting density
\begin{align}
  P(\bm{x},t)=<\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)>,
\end{align}
where I have used the definition that for some observable $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$,
\begin{align}
  <\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\bm{u}(t))>=\frac{1}{Z}\int\mathcal{D}\bm{u}
  \hat{\mathcal{O}}(\bm{u}(t))
  \exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\int_0^Tdt(\bm{u}(t))^2\bigg).
\end{align}
From this, I can calculate that noise-averaged current as
\begin{align}
  \bm{J}(\bm{x},t)=
  &\beta\bm{D}\cdot(\bm{F}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t)
  +\bm{v}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t))\nonumber\\
  &+\sqrt{2D_{\alpha\beta}}<u_{\beta}(t)\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)>.
\end{align}

In order to write the noise term above in terms of $P(\bm{x},t)$, I will use
the properties of the Dirac-delta function, namely,
\begin{align}
  \delta(\bm{x})=\int\frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^d}\exp(-ik_jx_j),
\end{align}
to write
\begin{align}
  <u_{\beta}\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)>=\int\frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^d}u_{\beta}(t)
  \exp(-ik_j(x_j-r_j(t))).
\end{align}

Since correlations between the noise
$<u_{\alpha}(t)u_{\beta}(t)>=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t^{\prime})$ only
occur for fluctuations happening at the same time, we can write
\begin{align}
  \bm{r}(t)=
  &\bm{r}(t-\Delta t)
  +\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1[\beta\bm{D}(\bm{F}(\bm{r}(t_1))
    +\bm{v}(\bm{r}(t_1)))\nonumber\\
    &+\sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}u_{\gamma}(t_1)]
\end{align}
as $\Delta t\to0$. Then, since
\begin{align}
  \exp\bigg[\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1(\bm{F}(\bm{r}(t_1)
  +\bm{v}({\bm{r}(t_1)})\bigg]=1+O(\Delta t),
\end{align}
this can be written as
\begin{widetext}
  \begin{align}
    <u_{\beta}(t)\exp(-ik_jr_j(t))>=
    &\bigg<u_{\beta}(t)\exp\bigg[-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t)-ik_j
      \int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1(F_j(\bm{r}(t_1)+v_j{\bm{r}(t_1)}
      +\sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}u_{\gamma}(t_1))\bigg]\bigg>\nonumber\\
    =&\bigg<u_{\beta}(t)\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))
    \bigg[1-ik_j\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1
      \sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}u_{\gamma}(t_1)\bigg]\bigg>+O(\Delta t).
  \end{align}
\end{widetext}
Next, since $t-\Delta t<t_1,t$, there won't be any correlations between the
fluctuations at earlier times and those at $t$, so using the fact that for uncorrelated
functions $<AB>=<A><B>$, I get
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
  <u_{\beta}(t)\exp(-ik_jr_j(t))>
  &=\bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  \bigg<u_{\beta}(t)\bigg[1-ik_j\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1
    \sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}u_{\gamma}(t_1)\bigg]\bigg>
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\
  &=\bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  \bigg(<u_{\beta}(t)>
  -\bigg<ik_j\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1
  \sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}u_{\gamma}(t_1)
  u_{\beta}(t)\bigg>\bigg)
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\
  &=-\bigg<ik_j\sqrt{2D_{j\gamma}}\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1
  \delta_{\beta \gamma}\delta(t-t_1)\bigg>
  \bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\
  &=-\bigg<ik_j\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}\int_{t-\Delta t}^tdt_1
  \delta(t-t_1)\bigg>
  \bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\
  &=-\bigg<ik_j\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}\int_0^{\Delta t}du
  \delta(u)\bigg>
  \bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\
  &=-\frac{1}{2}ik_j\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}
  \bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t-\Delta t))\bigg>
  +O(\Delta t)\nonumber\\.
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
Taking the limit as $\Delta t\to0$, this becomes
\begin{align}
  <u_{\beta}(t)&\exp(-ik_jr_j(t)>=\nonumber\\
  &-\frac{1}{2}ik_j\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}\bigg<\exp(-ik_jr_j(t))\bigg>.
\end{align}
Taking the inverse Fourier transform then gives
\begin{align}
  <u_{\beta}(t)\hat{\rho}(\bm{x},t)>=-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}
  \partial_jP(\bm{x},t).
\end{align}
Finally, inserting this into the current I get
\begin{align}
  J_{\alpha}(\bm{x},t)=
  &\beta D_{\alpha\beta}F_{\beta}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t)
  +\beta D_{\alpha\beta}v_{\beta}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t)\nonumber\\
  &+\sqrt{2D_{\alpha\beta}}\bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2D_{j\beta}}
  \partial_jP(\bm{x},t)\bigg)\nonumber\\
  =&\beta D_{\alpha\beta}F_{\beta}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t)
  +\beta D_{\alpha\beta}v_{\beta}(\bm{x})P(\bm{x},t)\nonumber\\
  &-\sqrt{D_{\alpha\beta}D_{\gamma\beta}}
  \partial_{\gamma}P(\bm{x},t))
\end{align}

Since in our case, $D_{\alpha\beta}$ is diagonal, this just gives eqn
\ref{eq:Nparticlecurrent} as desired.
