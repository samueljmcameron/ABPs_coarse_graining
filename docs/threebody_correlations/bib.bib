abstract  ="The pressure of suspensions of self-propelled objects is studied theoretically and by simulation of spherical active Brownian particles (ABPs). We show that for certain geometries{,} the mechanical pressure as force/area of confined systems can be equally expressed by bulk properties{,} which implies the existence of a nonequilibrium equation of state. Exploiting the virial theorem{,} we derive expressions for the pressure of ABPs confined by solid walls or exposed to periodic boundary conditions. In both cases{,} the pressure comprises three contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random forces{,} an activity-induced pressure (“swim pressure”){,} which can be expressed in terms of a product of the bare and a mean effective particle velocity{,} and the contribution by interparticle forces. We find that the pressure of spherical ABPs in confined systems explicitly depends on the presence of the confining walls and the particle–wall interactions{,} which has no correspondence in systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our simulations of three-dimensional ABPs in systems with periodic boundary conditions reveal a pressure–concentration dependence that becomes increasingly nonmonotonic with increasing activity. Above a critical activity and ABP concentration{,} a phase transition occurs{,} which is reflected in a rapid and steep change of the pressure. We present and discuss the pressure for various activities and analyse the contributions of the individual pressure components."}
